# IBM-Data-Science-Capstone-Project
In this project we collected data for the Top Tech cities in 2020 across North America using web scraping, Google geocoder API and Foursquare API. With the Foursquare API we obtained data on different venue locations across the top tech cities. We transformed this data and performed an exploratory data analysis showing the top ten most common venues and a bar plot of these across cities. With this we performed a KMeans clustering and developed a recommender system. This project was performed based on data from the Foursquare API, there may be limitations in generalizing the conclusions from the clusters because of the limited number of venues from each city. The generalization of results can be improved by looking further into city neighborhoods where tech jobs are available and follow the same procedure developed in this project.
